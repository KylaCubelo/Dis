    """
Iâ€™m Kyla, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student in my 2nd year, driven by a passion for coding and solving complex problems. Iâ€™ve honed my programming skills and enjoy not only creating innovative solutions but also mentoring others and contributing to impactful projects.

Outside of my professional journey, Iâ€™m equal parts dreamer and doer. I love playing volleyball, journaling, exploring cute bookstores, and baking cookies (even if they donâ€™t always turn out perfect!). Youâ€™ll often find me embracing spontaneous road trips, long coffee dates, and deep late-night conversations.

Life, to me, is a blend of chasing big dreams and finding joy in everyday moments. Whether itâ€™s conquering my career goals or cherishing little adventures, I aim to make a positive impact in my community and stay curious about all the possibilities the world has to offer. ðŸ’•    """
